# UART-protocol-design-and-simulation-using-verilog-
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a simple serial communication protocol that sends data bit by bit without a clock signal. It uses start and stop bits for synchronization, supports configurable baud rates, and enables full-duplex communication between devices such as microcontrollers, sensors, and PCs.
